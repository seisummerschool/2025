                    Prof. Dong Jin-Song’s research interests include formal methods, safety and security systems, probabilistic reasoning, sports analytics, trusted machine learning, and verified LLM code synthesis. He co-founded the commercialized PAT verification system, and the commercialized trusted machine learning system Silas (www.depintel.com). He served on the editorial board of ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology, Formal Aspects of Computing, and Innovations in Systems and Software Engineering, A NASA Journal. He has successfully supervised 33 PhD students, many of whom have become tenured faculty members at leading universities worldwide. He is also a Fellow of the Institute of Engineering Australia. Jin Song developed Markov Decision Process (MDP) models for tennis strategy analysis using PAT, assisting professional players with pre-match analysis (outperforming the world's best). In his spare time, he is a Junior Grand Slam coach and takes pleasure in coaching tennis to his students, and his three children, all of whom have reached the #1 national junior ranking in Singapore/Australia. Two of his children have earned US NCAA Tennis Division-1 full scholarships.

                <h5>Trusted AI and Reasoning Beyond LLM</h5>
                <p>
                    The rise of code-centric Large Language Models (LLMs) has reshaped the software engineering world with tools like Copilot and Open AI 03 that can easily generate code. However, there is no correctness guarantee for the code generated by LLMs, which suffer from the hallucination problem. The first part of this talk shows that the program refinement calculus can be used as a formal chain of thought to guide LLM and verify the correctness of the LLM-generated code. The second part of this talk investigates LLM-aided System Design, where LLM-enhanced formal methods agents are proposed. The third part of this talk shows the weakness of LLM in solving strategy analysis problems where formal reasoning techniques are needed.

                <h5>Game-theoretic Approach to LTLf Planning and Synthesis</h5>
                <p>
                    This course introduces AI planning and program synthesis for tasks (goals) expressed over finite traces. Specifically, borrowing from Formal Methods, we will consider tasks and environment specifications expressed in LTL and in particular its finite trace variant LTLf. We will review the main results and algorithmic techniques to handle planning in nondeterministic domains. Then, we will draw connections with verification, and reactive synthesis, together with their game-theoretic solution techniques. The main catch is that working with these logics can be based on devising suitable 2-player games and finding strategies, i.e., plans, to win them. Specifically, we will cover the following topics: Planning in Nondeterministic Domains, Temporal Logics, LTL, LTLf, PPLTL, Game-theoretic Techniques, and Reactive Synthesis.

                    John Hughes is a long-time functional programming researcher, one of the designers of Haskell, and also interested in testing since 2000 
                    when he and Koen Claessen developed the first version of QuickCheck. With Thomas Arts he co-founded a company, Quviq, in 2006, 
                    to commercialize the ideas, and has helped many customers to apply property-based testing in practice since then. He has held professorships 
                    at the University of Glasgow and at Chalmers University, and is now Emeritus Professor at the latter. He is a Fellow of the ACM, and holder of 
                    an ACM SIGPLAN Most Influential Paper award for the original QuickCheck paper.    
                </p>

                <h5>Property-based testing</h5>
                <p>
                    Property-based testing is an approach to software testing that uses

                    generated tests to test software against a formal specification
                    
                    expressed as properties. Originating as a library in Haskell, nowadays
                    
                    it is supported in most programming languages, and is seeing
                    
                    increasing use in industry as well as academia.
                    
                     
                    
                    In these lectures we will begin with a demonstration of property-based
                    
                    testing and some war stories from industrial applications. Then we
                    
                    will introduce the fundamentals of property-based testing: properties,
                    
                    generators, and shrinkers. We will go on to show how systems with
                    
                    internal state are modelled and tested, including some recent features
                    
                    inspired by dynamic logic that have been used to test smart
                    
                    contracts. Finally we will discuss the importance of gathering
                    
                    appropriate statistics when using random testing, and show how unit
                    
                    test ideas can be used to suggest useful statistics to collect.

                    She is an EPSRC Established Career Fellow and an Honorary Fellow at Glasgow University. 
                    Last 10 years, her main research interests are theories and applications of protocols specifications and verifications. 
                    She introduced multiparty session types [ POPL’08, JACM ] which received Most Influential POPL Paper Award in 2018 (judged by its influence over the last decade). 
                    This work enlarged the community and widened the scope of applications of session types, e.g. runtime monitoring based on Scribble (co-developed with Red Hat) 
                    has been deployed to other projects such as cyberinfrastructure in the US Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI);

                <h5>From Binary Session Types to Multiparty Session Types </h5>
                <p>
                   Session types are a type-theoretic approach to specifying communication protocols so that they can be verified by various methods such as static type-checking, 
                    type-inference and runtime-checking. The theory has been developed over the last 30 years since the first paper on session types, by Kohei Honda at CONCUR 1993. 
                    Recently the topic has attracted increasing interest, and a substantial community and literature have developed. 
                    Most theoretical and programming language conferences now include several papers on session types each year. 
                    In terms of the technical focus, there have been continuing theoretical developments (notably the generalisation from two-party to multi-party session types) 
                    and a variety of implementations of session types as programming language extensions or libraries, covering (among others) Haskell, OCaml, Java, Scala, Rust, Python, MPI-C, C#, Go, TypeScript and Erlang.

                   The course will start from a simple binary session types to multiparty session types. 
                    The lectures include the tutorials. 
                   Some knowledge of operational semantics or typing systems of any calculi or languages will be helpful but not required.
